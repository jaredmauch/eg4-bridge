# eg4-bridge

eg4-bridge is a tool for monitoring and controlling EG4 inverters locally. It is based on the work originally done by @Chris Elsworth for LuxPower inverters.

It allows you to monitor and possibly control your inverter locally.

I don't use home assistant, but the original implemention by @celsworth included it, so it should be easy to revive.  My main focus is on sending data to influx v1

## Documentation

I am attempting to provide a more stable set of documentation with the EG4 brand devices, which are (were?) compatible with the LuxPower inverters.  It may also work for other inverters.

The tests are still from the original version and I expect will be revived, help with maintaining this is welcome.

## Pull requests

Issues and pull requests are welcome, and co-maintainers will be considered if you send a PR.

It is always helpful if you provide details about what device and configuration you are using.
